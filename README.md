# POV_Ejercicio2

In this excercise, we are required to do two tasks:
- Firstly, we need to create a new WebGL Program to create the shadows. As this is a new program, we have to bind again all buffers or they won't be accesible from the
recently create program. We also have to assign the black color to the color attributes.

- Secondly, we have to add functionality to the wasd keys. Since one of them was already added, the code only needed a small variation on the positive or negative value
of its parameters as shown.
